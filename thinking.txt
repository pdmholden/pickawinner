Brainstorming
-------------

start with two-digit numbers
if encounter duplicate of a two-digit number,
  use digits separately as picks
if single digit >= 6, it *must* be used alone
if any character has to be discarded, fail
every time settle on a pick, need to check duplicates OR
  check for duplicates at the end
define calculation to know how many two-digit picks must
  be in the result to use every char
  strlen - 7 = number of two-digit picks required
if there are > 10 digits, there are guaranteed to be
  single-digit duplicates
"3462..." -> 3, 46, 2 OR 34, 6, 2 OR 3, 4, 6, 2
